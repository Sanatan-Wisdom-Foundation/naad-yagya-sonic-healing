**Naad Yagya** is a research-led initiative under the **Sanatan Wisdom Foundation**, founded by **Devrishi**, exploring the intersection of Vedic mantra science, neuroscience, and consciousness-based healing. This repository tracks the academic, experimental, and institutional development of the project through open research and structured milestones.

## 📜 About the Project
Naad Yagya blends sacred sound rituals with modern EEG/HRV analysis to understand how mantras affect brainwave patterns, stress response, and mental clarity. The work is conducted through the **Nada Yoga Research Institute (NYRI)**, the research wing of the Foundation.

> "We are reviving mantra not as faith, but as frequency – measurable, replicable, and deeply human." — *Devrishi*
